\label{sec:conclusion}

The implementation of this project and this report has partly been a success.\\

Throughout the writing of the six summaries of the theory from this reading course a much better understanding of the theory has been obtained.\\

This has been a great basis for the attempt to implement the theory in a practical problem. This implementation worked most of the time in simulations but unfortunately this did not get to be carried out in a real-life problem.
