\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:prokect_introduction}

This section describes the projectwork carried out as part of the course AI In Robotics. The aim of the project is to apply the theory learned during the course by implementing the algorithms and techniques in software to be executed on a simple robotic platform.
In this project the main focus have been on the software implementation, by using a hardware platform running a robot operating system (ROS) which provides high-level abstractions for execution of control-inputs and delivery of lidar readings.\\

Hardware, software, simulation, and testing will be described in further detail in the subsequent sections, and lastly we give a discussion about our results ending with a conclusion of the project.
