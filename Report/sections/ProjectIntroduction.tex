This chapter describes the projectwork carried out as part of the course AI In Robotics. The aim of the project is to apply the theory learned during the course by implementing the algorithms and methods and simulating and/or executing the result on some robot platform.\\
In this project the main focus have been on the software implementations of the theory, and the hardware concerns have been given a lower priority made possible by using a hardware platform running a robot operating system (ROS) that provides high-level abstractions for execution of control-inputs and obtaining measurements data.\\

Hardware, software, simulation, and test will be described in greater detail in the subsequent sections, and we give a discussion about our results ending with a conclusion of the project.
