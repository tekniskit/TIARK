When a robot has located itself the next task might be to go somewhere. The task of planning a path from the location of the robot to some goal location is, when talking about robots, often referred to as robot motion planning. The problem to solve is to find the best possible path for the goal location when knowing the start location, the map and maybe some kind of cost function. This cost function can be thought of as the time it takes to follow a certain route. When introducing this cost function the best possible path is the minimum cost path. \\

The path planning can be looked at as a search problem. A search problem is a problem with a set of nodes, an initial node and a goal node. The search problem can be solved by using the search algorithm. The search algorithm starts at the initial node and searches throughout all the nodes in order to find the goal node. A variant of this search algorithm has been developed in order to handle the problem of path planning better. This algorithm is referred to as A* (pronounced A star). \\

To understand the A* algorithm the understanding of the search algorithm should be obtained.
